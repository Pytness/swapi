## Overview
This technical test evaluates your ability to work with APIs, write clean code, and implement proper testing practices using the Star Wars API (SWAPI). The test focuses on both implementation and testing skills.

## Requirements

### 1. API Client Implementation
Create a Python client for the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/) that should:
- Handle API requests efficiently
- Implement proper error handling
- Include type hints
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include docstrings for all methods

### 2. Core Functionality
Implement the following methods in your API client:
- Get character information by ID
- Get planet information by ID
- Search for characters by name
- Get all characters from a specific film
- Get all films a character appears in

### 3. Testing Requirements
Write comprehensive tests that cover:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error cases (invalid IDs, network errors, etc.)
- Edge cases
- Response validation
- API rate limiting handling

### 4. Code Quality
Your implementation should demonstrate:
- Clean code principles
- Proper separation of concerns
- Efficient error handling
- Type safety
- Documentation
